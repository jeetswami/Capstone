# Introduction

Bike-sharing systems are transforming urban mobility, providing an eco-friendly alternative to traditional transportation. However, managing bike availability is a challenge due to fluctuating demand. This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to predict bike rental demand, optimizing fleet management and resource allocation.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of hourly records of bike-sharing demand with 17 features, including:

Temporal Features: Date, season, hour, weekday, holiday, working day.
Weather Features: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions.
Target Variable: Total rental bike count (casual + registered).

# Methodology

The project involved the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations.
Model Training: Implementing various machine learning models to forecast demand.
Model Evaluation: Comparing models based on performance metrics like RÂ², MSE, and RMSE.

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Visualization Tools: Heatmaps, Line Charts, Feature Importance Graphs
Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
